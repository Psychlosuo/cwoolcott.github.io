How to Randomize value in an array
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5915096/get-random-item-from-javascript-array
fastFoodJoints = ["Sonic", "McDonalds", "White Castle", "Arbys"];
//Picks out a Random Index using the length of the array (fyi: random gives us 0 through 1 in tiny increments, never being 0 or 1. Floor gives us the integer lowerest, 2.234235 is 2)
todayIWillEat = fastFoodJoints[Math.floor(Math.random()*fastFoodJoints.length)];
alert("Today I will eat " + todayIWillEat);

Use charAt()
The charAt() method returns the character at the specified index in a string.

name = "Chris";
alert(name.charAt(0)); //Alerts C

Use charAt()
onkeyup is an event we can hook onto. It will trigger when a key is pressed(technically...when a key is released)
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onkeyup.asp
<p id="change">
HI
</p>
<script>
// Replaces the html inside of this tag with whatever Key was pressed 
document.onkeyup = function(event) {
    document.getElementById("change").innerHTML = String.fromCharCode(event.keyCode);
}
</script>
